     + Time saving 
    + effort less
* computational easeness
* Store calculated values for energies


## SWOT ANALYSIS
![SWOT](https://github.com/The-lana/314189_miniproject/blob/main/1_Requirements/SWOT.png)

# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who:

**Students and scientist**

## What:

**Companies that use energy can easily calculate energy and as such use minimum energy required.**

## When:

**The energy calculation is done to analyze how much energy is stored as well as how much energy is wasted and as such ensure minimum usage of energy**

## Where:

**It can be used in analysis and calculation as well as analyzing energy loss  using the program**

## How:

**The user can enter the values of object and calculate kinetic,gravitational and mechanical energy**
